## Problem Statement
<br/>
With so much educational content over internet, we still have plenty of **people who don’t have a job** or having a one they don’t like: It is hard for people to identify potential opportunities because they don’t know about them.
<br/>
On the other side, many **companies** are eager to onboard who can help them to reach goals, but they can not hire these people until they fit a work profile.
  
<br/>

### Users & Audience

Students who start their career  
Career changers  
People that want to level up their careers  
Learners  
Recruiters  
Mentors who want to contribute to the professional community  
Teachers who work remotely  
<br/>

### The Need

**Students**  that are looking for work at a certain company, and would like to understand their skill gap and how long it will take them to reach their goals. They want to ensure that the time they spend learning will make them a prepared candidate for a certain position.  
**Mentors** that are looking for a properly organized schedule, clear communication flow with a mentee, see their results and how they are progressing.  
**Recruters** that are looking for people who fit their target profile and match the job criteria.  
**Administrators** that are looking for a system that works correctly for all users. This includes having a database for all the candidates and vacancies, learning resources, user reports, all in one place.

## Solution 
**For jobseekers**:
- A seamless personal profile creation
- Search tools
- Recommended jobs according to their preferences
- A clear illustration of skillset matches with the requirements of a particular position 
- Skill gaps identification and a pool of  learning programs of filling it out 
- Goal setting, visualization, progress tracking  

**For recruiters/company**:
- The platform allows the company to create a job position and find perfect candidates.  

**For experienced professionals**:
- The platform allows to build a bridge between the job seekers and experienced professionals through the mentorship program   


## Research
I joined the team when they passed the first stage of product development without the designer. I had analyzed and tested out user flaws and found the platform totally unfriendly, starting with a confusing landing page, complicated registration steps, and a Home page of the platform illustrating some data I have no idea what it is. 
I started by identifying the user personas, and their goals, and made research on education and recruiting services.
Analysis of the market and the competitors' product application content help me to identify and define business requirements.

    </div>
</div>

I conducted user interviews with our target audience that had previously used one or more education platforms and subscribed to the job seekers platform. Here are some major takeaways:  
<br/>
- Education apps are extremely popular, but they do not provide exact information according to your job searching goals
- Enrollment to various study programs on the different platforms is complex and difficult to handle
- The progress in acquiring a particular degree does not guarantee that you fulfill all the requirements/skill sets needed for the real positions
- A few interviewees mentioned the need for weekly to-do lists and information on what to expect during weekly sessions  
- Recruiters can see your existing expertise but don't know what job position you are looking for  
<br/>
Thanks to the insights learned from our initial research, I created a System Requirement Chart to specify the priorities that guided me to the proposed solution. 



### Information Architecture

I analyzed the information architecture and user flow of the “CareerPath” and based on my research created a new structure for the platform.

### Wireframes

I created low-fidelity sketches to get a general idea of what the user interface should look like. I built high-fidelity wireframes and visual mockups on Figma later on.

Using atomic design principles, I created elements that would be repeatable across the app to create consistency and user-friendliness of different content types.

### Visual Design


The main goal of the current design stage was to test the platform's existing user flow and content. 
When the pros and cons of the current design approach were identified, I proceeded to a new design iteration.

## Outcomes & Lessons Learned
 

Next time I would do more research before the development process starts: I will conduct competitor analysis, clearly identify the MVP and its functions, the goals of the project, and at which stage they can be considered as achieved, will prepare a detailed plan, and track the progress. I will emphasize the unique selling proposition (USP). 
Before immersing yourself in the user experience design, it is important to discuss in detail with the stakeholders and development team what a project is and make sure everyone has a clear understanding of the project's mission and vision. One of the biggest problems I faced in my work was the different understanding of the product by the developers and founders and the lack of quantitative and qualitative metrics to set the right priorities, and long-term strategy.
