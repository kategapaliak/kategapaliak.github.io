overview: An Alpbook app is built for climbers and mountaineers to showcase their personal achievements and assist with planning & booking the next trip with ease, provides all the necessary information on organized climbing from trusted professionals.Alpbook allows the climbers' coaches to review and validate the professional level of every user. What is more, Alpbook also allows mountaineering coaches to find clients via an app and sign agreements with them. In such a way, Alpbook is a database of mountain routes with all necessary details provided by certified coaches and trusted members of the professional climber community, with which you can sign your next contract.

## Problem Statement
- The complexity of finding alp routes matching the necessary criteria
- The complexity of preparation for the trip
- Team formation - it is difficult to find people with the same level of training and experience, and establish the contacts for teamwork
- A need to distribute the responsibility for the individual and team equipment supply
- Lack of a comprehensive picture of participants' previous climbing experience

## Users & Audience

Climbers, mountaineers, active people, sportsmen 

Coaches

Members Climbing and Mountaineering Federation and Alpine Clubs


### Solution

Alpbook solves two crucial problems for both sides of the marketplace – climbers (travelers) and coaches (tour operators).

<b>For Climbers</b>

<b style="font-weight: 500">Base of routes in the phone:</b>
- Search for routes by different criteria
- A detailed description of the planned route from the author-organizer

<b style="font-weight: 500">Possibility to track your achievements:</b>
- memorize your experience and special points

<b style="font-weight: 500">Trip organizer:</b>
- The ability to track the team formation process
- A clear understanding of participants profiles with their previous experience and their contacts 
- Calendar of joint training and events related to the trip preparation
- A list of equipment needed with a clear indication of the people, who are responsible for the equipment
- A system of reminders for all organizational points

<b style="font-weight: 500">Create a community</b>

<b>For Coaches</b>

Sale their services, be connected


## Surveys & User Interviews

I ran a survey that helped me to get a deep-dive understanding of the climbers’ world, including their attitudes and concerns. Based on the results, I formulated specific interview questions to find out more about climbers’ needs. 
I organized the interviews in a local training gym with potential app users. While I talked with climbers I better understood their goals and challenges and refined the problem statement further.


### Affinity Map

I created an Aﬃnity Map to get a comprehensive understanding of the collected data during the interviews and to identify the valuable insights.

## User Personas

I created user personas based on the generative user research that captures the essence of my target group. 

Paul and Anna helped me to always be on track with the users’ needs.

## Information Architecture

User flow structure refers to how pages are laid out, connected, and the different levels of hierarchy within the app. 

A user will have to navigate to subpages from the “Home” page.  There are two possible user scenarios - sign up and become a registered user or use limited app content without registration.  Each app’s subpage leads to a series of its own subpages.

## Wireframes

Once I have defined the user flow and information architecture of the app, I started to sketch it out.

I have used the mid-fidelity prototype and started user testing.

    <div class="col-md-12">
        <figure>
            <div class="gallery">
                <img class="img-fluid" alt="" src="/images/alpbook/AB_5.png">
            </div>
        </figure>
        <figcaption>Wireframes 1st iteration</figcaption>
    </div>
</div>


## Usability Test

I conducted 5 user interviews in person to test the mid-fidelity prototype. 

I used Sketch for the wireframes and InVision for the prototype. I set up an action plan to test and came up with a couple of templates.

The goal of this study is to assess the user experience of the Alpbook app for new users that interact with it for the first time on their smartphone. 

The idea was to observe and measure if users understand the app and whether they are capable of doing three actions I asked them to do. The goal was to identify any problems and fix them.

Afterward, I analyzed the test results and created the second iteration of mid-fidelity wireframes.


<div class="row">
    <div class="col-md-12">
        <figure>
            <div class="gallery">
                <img class="img-fluid" alt="" src="/images/alpbook/AB_6.png">
            </div>
        </figure>
        <figcaption>Wireframes 2nd iteration</figcaption>
    </div>
</div>


## Usability Test Results

- User testing has been very useful to see the necessary app improvements and how the users interact with the app and what are their expectations.
- In overall, all the tests were conducted successfully and all the participants were able to complete the tasks with more or less effort.
- After doing the tests, I have made significant changes in the app. I have changed the navigation system, moved the left sidebar to the bottom, rearranged information architecture and added more details.



## Visual Design

I created polished design mockups, each with proper alignment, size, color, and suitable imagery based on the framework established in the wireframes & mid-fidelity mockups. 

I conducted preference tests as a point of reference to my design decisions.

A minimalistic primary color palette throughout the app served not only to assist the user navigation,  but to provide the visual clues for different content types.

A simple, clean design gave users an easy way to search for deals they needed.




## Final UI

The color palette is made up of a color scheme consisting of orange & shades of grey.

The primary color is orange and is in contrast with mountain landscapes and fairly visible with winter and summer photos.

## Outcomes & Lessons Learned

I have spent 1 month working on this project. I started with brainstorming and ended with deploying the interactive prototype and finally analyzing each process in this case study.

Lessons learned:
- Projects are never ideal and it is important to be flexible and learn how to adapt to the circumstances.
- During the user interviews, it was key to ask only those questions that are related to user behavior and avoid forward-facing questions.
