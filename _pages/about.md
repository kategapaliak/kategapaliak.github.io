<br>

I was born in Ukraine and grew up in Lviv. I studied at National University “Lviv Polytechnic”, and obtained a master's degree in architecture and monumental heritage restoration.

From 2008 to 2017, I’ve been working as an architect in Lviv. 
In 2016, I completed a course of basic UI/UX and started my design journey in web, mobile and app design. The same things that drew me to designing physical spaces eventually drew me to the digital world - with a passion for user-centered design, an appreciation for aesthetics, the desire to dig deeper in context and tackle complex problems. As it turns out, there are many similarities between these two professions.

Since 2017, I’ve been working part time and designing user experience for web and mobile and bringing up my daughter.

When I’m not designing, I am likely to travel and experience new cultures, enjoying the urban and natural landscapes, run or sketch with a cup of coffee.
